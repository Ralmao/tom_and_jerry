Using convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification model tom and jerry image
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm that is commonly used for image classification, object detection, and segmentation. CNNs are able to learn features from images by applying a series of convolution operations.

TensorFlow is an open-source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. TensorFlow can be used to implement CNNs, and it provides a number of tools and resources to make it easy to do so.

TensorFlow provides a number of other tools and resources for working with CNNs. For example, TensorFlow has a number of pre-trained CNN models that can be used for image classification. TensorFlow also provides a number of tutorials and examples that can help you learn how to use CNNs.
